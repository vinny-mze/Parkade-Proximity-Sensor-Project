REFERENCE MANUAL FOR PiHAT PCB

The operating temperature of the piHAT PCB is between -13 and 52 degrees celsius. The PCB works well in that temperature range. Using the PCB in temperatures outside this temperature range will lead to a change in normal functioning of the sensor system and the malfunctioning of some of the components of the PCB. 

The sensor system uses the power supply of the uPiHAT system. Connecting the uPiHAT PCB to power will automatically switch on the sensor system and it will start working from there. The switch of the PiHAT system can be added by any user of this PiHAT system and it is an optional component you can add depending on how you want to use this PiHAT PCB sensor system.

Casing of the PiHAT PCB will be the responsibility of the user of the sensor system depending on how they want to use the PiHAT PCB.

When using the proximity sensor of the PiHAT PCB, as an object comes closer to the Sensor, more LED lights will switch on to indicate the object's distance from the sensor. There are three LED lights in total. Unwanted objects should not be placed in front of the sensor system so that the PiHAT system functions properly.

`  `The PiHAT PCB can be used in moist environments. However, for it to be used int these moist areas without affecting the PCB components, the PCB should be properly protected with a case (plastic casing is recommended) to avoid PCB components getting affected by the moisture or water. Casing of the PCB is a feature that can be requested by the user if they want the PCB cased depending on how they want to use the PCB.

the only additional components you will need for the PCB to work is a power supply. Casing is optional and will be used if its necessary to protect the PCB from the external environment.
