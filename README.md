Proximity sensor: License and README File

This HAT is a proximity sensor used in Parkade Parking and Home garages
It is used to aid in parking by switching on LED lights if a car gets too close to the wall.

How to use it
Attach sensor to wall
Ensure that all LED lights are in full view of driver's rear mirror
Plug in to 3V-75V DC Source
Keep away from direct sunlight

If car is within 4m from the sensor, 1 LED will switch on this means proceed
If car is within 1.5m from the sensor, 2 LEDs will switch on this means proceed with more caution
if car is less than 0.5m from the wall, all LEDs will switch on this means STOP
