uPiHAT manufacturing notes

This document will help you with creating or manufacturing your own version of this uPiHAT PCB.

\1) The Bill of Materials is available in the BOM file of this uPiHAT PCB system.

\2) Draw the circuit of the PCB using the KiCad schematic system. 

\3) Check the circuit for errors using the KiCad schematic system to avoid any possible errors in the normal functioning of the uPiHAT PCB.

\4) Annotate the schematic symbols in the KiCad schematic system.

\5) Assign PCB footprints for your schematic symbols. 

\6) Open the PCB editor of the project you are creating. 

\7) Load the current netlist to load all the PCB footprints you assigned to schematic symbols.

\8) Arrange the PCB footprints in a way that will have the smallest number of crosses between the tracks you are going to create which will link the PCB footprints according to the schematic design.

\9) Draw the tracks of the PCB staritng with the tracks of the components that are closest to each other. 

\10) Draw the other tracks of the components far away from each other by drawing tracks that will connect the components on the other side of the PCB. This means the track will be of a different colour from the tracks of step 9.

\11) Check for possible errors in the PCB system.

\12) Check the 3D viewer to see if you are satisfied with the design. 

\13) Save the files and send them to a PCB designer so that they may manufacture the physical PCBs for you.
