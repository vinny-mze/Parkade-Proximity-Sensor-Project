Getting Started with the uPiHAT PCB

\1) To start using the PCB, connect the uPiHAT PCB to your power supply.

\2) If a switch is of high importance to you, add it as an additional component when connecting the PCB to the power supply. 

\3) Test the uPiHat if it is properly working by bringing any test object closer to the proximity sensor. 

\4) Check if all the LED lights are switching on.
